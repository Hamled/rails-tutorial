rails-tutorial
==============

Code built while following the tutorial at RailsTutorial.org

Because there are completely different RoR projects for different sections of the tutorial I'm using different branches for each chapter.
Chapter 1 contains the first_app project, chapter 2 contains the demo_app project, and chapters following that contain the sample_app project.
For Chapters 4+ I'll still create a new branch per chapter but will do so by branching from the previous chapter rather than from master.
